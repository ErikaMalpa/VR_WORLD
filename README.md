## Project Description
Our group decided to use Unity to create our project as we thought it would be a fun way to learn the
C# language.

This repository accomodates our group project which is a SURVIVAL VR GAME developed using Unity C# for Google Cardboard.
The terrain in this game which is a representation of an abandoned planet was procedurally made using Blender.


### Game Objectives:

### Game Controls
First person controller (FPS)

### We made 2 scripts:
1.Look walk :
- allows automatic walking for user to navigate thru the VR world
- the user must tilt the phone device to trigger the auto walk

2. Keyboard:
- press arrow keys to walk
- shift key to accelerate speed
- space key to jump
 
Here is the link for the video of the game:

## Design Patterns and Concepts used
1.Creational Patterns - Singleton
2.Delegates, Events and Singletons with Unity3D
3.Coroutine
4.Game Managers
5.Used ReSharper for code inspection
6.Test Runner

## Struggles in VR Unity and use of Github
- We had to teach ourselves how to use Unity and Blender as we have no prior experience with these technology
- MobileVR did not work in the first time we attempted launching it in the Android - we thought it's the GVR SDK
- Attempted modifying the build settings and the project settings
- bluetooth controller not working
- github - source controlling unity metadata files consumes so much of our time; tried YAML to prevent it
